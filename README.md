- [x] Added additional sections to the HTML file.

- [x] Added links to `#navbar__list` dynamically using JavaScript according to the sections present in the HTML file.
- [x] Controlled the visibility of the `your-active-class` according to the the visible section on screen using `getBoundingClientRect`.
- [x] Used `addEventListener` connected with the click event to smoothly scroll to the clicked section with 0.5 second duration by `setTimeout`.
- [x] Added a button to scroll up smoothly to the top of the page when clicked, disabled initially. (HTML & CSS)
- [x] Added JQuery `<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.js"></script>` to use for the Go-To-Top button and its smoothness in scrolling upwards.
- [x] Using JavaScript, the scroll to the top of the page button is made visible when the user scrolls down 100 pixels from top by changing the `display` attribute between `"block"` and `"none"`.
- [x] The navigation bar is visible when the page loads, but when the user scrolls - `setTimeout` is used to count 2 seconds before changing the  `display` attribute from `"block"` to `"none"` and changes back when the user scrolls again.
